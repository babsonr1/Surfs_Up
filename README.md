# Surfs_Up
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to experiment with flask using local hosts. It was also to use sqlalchemy to read a sqlite file to get all the necessary data to begin the proect. The rest was simply done with dataframes and descriptive statistics.
## Results
The results show that there are some differences between June and December in terms of temperature.
- The mean temperature was almost exactly 6 degrees less in December.
- The minimum temperature was 11 degrees less than the minimum in June.
- The maximum temperature was 5 degrees less in December than in June.
## Summary
The conclusion is that the temperatures in the months June and December are different. The data clearly shows that the average temperature is much less in December than it is in June. Similarly, the minimum and maximum temperatures are both much lower in December than in June. This would most likely mean that the city that was being tested was in the Northern Hemisphere, and, more specifically, in the 15-30 degrees North area, as the temperatures maintain relatively high and do not swing too much between months, as compared to some other countries.
